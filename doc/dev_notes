design of cenozo based application - general

- design database in mysql workbench

- open sabretooth's .mwb file and  remove non-essential sabretooth tables as required
to create a template .mwb file for your app

- import your app's db design.sql into the template and edit as required

- export forward engineer, filtering out all cenozo table objects,
turn off views and triggers as required to schema.sql

- to get the app to run during development, there must be the following databases:
name_myapp
name_beartooth
name_cenozo
name_mastodon
name_sabretooth
name_sabretooth_mc
name_limesurvey
name_limesurvey2

- create db in mysql:
create database name_myapp;
grant all on name_myapp.* to 'name'@'localhost';

- create all the other 'name_*' dbs listed above

- run the "load" script in /home/?/files/data/db to preload data into all the 
listed db's

- import the schema.sql into mysql:
sed -e "s/\`\(myapp\|cenozo\)\`/\`name_\1\`/g" schema.sql | mysql name_app

- import the cenozo operations from cenozo/sql/operations.sql
mysql name_myapp < operations.sql

- import the customized cenozo/sql/operations.sql from myapp/sql into name_app db:
mysql name_myapp < operations.sql

- setup myapp/web/settings.ini.php

- setup myapp/web/settings.local.ini.php from a copy of settings.local.ini.php.sample

- create roles for myapp db using a customized copy of cenozo/sql/roles.sql

- use sed to change the default name of myapp and cenozo db's as required:
sed -e "s/\(myapp\|cenozo\)/name_\1/g" roles.sql | mysql name_myapp

- log into mastodon, add a service with name="myapp", title="MyApp"
Version="0.1.0" or whatever version is in myapp/web/settings.ini.php

- view details about service "myapp" , add Cohort list (tracking, comprehensive)
and Role List entries (administrator, typist)

- create a site in Mastodon: eg., McMaster (myapp)

- add an administrator level user (and other roles as required) to User List in Mastodon

- in the site list view, choose users to grant access to the new site along with roles

- create base classes for all tables in myapp db that have a primary id column
(use cenozo/api/database/event.class.php as a stub)

- create a symbolic link public_html in your root user directory
- create symbolic links to cenozo and your app's repository web folders
- create the log file in the root of your app's repository: touch log, chmod 666 log
- for testing, release participants from name_cenozo with
insert into service_has_participant (service_id, participant_id, datetime) select service.id, participant.id, utc_timestamp() from service, participant where service.name='cedar';
