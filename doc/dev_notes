design of cenozo based application - general

- design database in mysql workbench

- open sabretooth's .mwb file and  remove non-essential sabretooth tables as required
to create a template .mwb file for your app

- import your app's db design.sql into the template and edit as required

- export forward engineer, filtering out all cenozo table objects,
turn off views and triggers as required to schema.sql

- create db in mysql:
create database name_myapp;
grant all on name_myapp.* to 'name'@'localhost';

- import the schema.sql into mysql:
sed -e "s/\`\(myapp\|cenozo\)\`/\`name_\1\`/g" schema.sql | mysql name_app

- import the customized cenozo/sql/operations.sql from myapp/sql into name_app db:
mysql name_myapp < operations.sql

- setup myapp/web/settings.ini.php

- setup myapp/web/settings.local.ini.php from a copy of settings.local.ini.php.sample

- create roles for myapp db using a customized copy of cenozo/sql/roles.sql

- use sed to change the default name of myapp and cenozo db's as required:
sed -e "s/\(myapp\|cenozo\)/name_\1/g" roles.sql | mysql name_myapp

- log into mastodon, add a service with name="myapp", title="Cedar"
Version="0.1.0" or whatever version is in myapp/web/settings.ini.php
