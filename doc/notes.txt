Test-entry design
=================

order of tests:
  FAS F words
  FAS A words
  FAS S words
  REY1
  AFT
  counting & alphabet check
  MAT
  REY2

REY (1 & 2 identical)
  table: test_entry_ranked_word
  defined set of 15 words which are either yes/no/variant_word_id
  variants from a list of approved words, if not in that list then it's an intrusion instead (and word gets marked as no)
  may also have 0 to n intrusion_word_id (unordered)
  alg for scoring: rank doesn't matter

  - make variant dict for each word in the test instead of one dictionary for the whole test
  - intrusions at any time, not only after words are entered
  - need to add opposite language as variant

AFT
  table: test_entry_classification
  ordered list of animal names
  allow words to be re-ordered
  duplicate words are recorded
  0 to n entries, current max of 65

  if in dict, add word
  if in mispelled dict, doesn't let them add it
  otherwise adds word to variant list (which gets cleaned)
    when submitting add "you have variants, are you sure??"

FAS
  table: test_entry_classification
  three separate tests: F, A and S words
  ordered list of words are recorded
  primary words: "correct" words, approved and starting with the correct letter
  intrusion words: words that start with the wrong letter
  mispelled words: ??
  variant: ??
  0 to n entries, current max of 65

MAT
  table: test_entry_alpha_numeric
  ordered set of letters (single-letter only) and numbers
  non-letter-or-numbers are not recorded (ignored)
  duplicate words are to be recorded
  0 to n entries, current max of 53

INTERFACE

if null == misspelled || true == misspelled
  don't show aft/fas valid
else
  aft/fas valid shown and can be freely changed
  if aft_valid
    show animal word list
  if fas_valid
    show compound word list
    show homophone word list
    show sister word list

DATABASE

word 1-to-N compound words
  set in stone
  language dependent
  "master" word may have multiple compounds

word 1-to-N homophone words
  set in stone
  language dependent?
  "master" word may have multiple homophones
  homophones only ever have one "master" word

word 1-to-N sister words
  language independent
  "master" word may have multiple sister words
  sister words only ever have one "master" word

animal group 1-to-N word
  language independent
  word may belong to one "animal group" only
  animal groups may have multiple words

if misspelled is changed to true
  set aft/fas valid to false
  delete all animal word list entries
  delete all compound word list entries
  delete all homophone word list entries
  delete all sister word list entries
fi

if aft_valid is changed to false
  delete all animal word list entries

if fas_valid is changed to false
